# Wage Prediction: A Regression Competition

***
This DS project is a result of the 7th [FLAI](https://www.flai.com.br/) Machine Learning Competition. 
The aim of the contest was to build a model that predicts wage with the smallest mean absolute error. 

This model won 1st place in the Competition.

For a better understanding, this was divided in 3 parts: Data Analysis, Machine Learning Algorithm and Deploy. The last one was not part of the competition but a way to practise the last DS step.

Note: Although the code cells are in english, the explanation and result interpretations (markdown cells) are in portuguese.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: [EDA]()
* ML: [Algorithm]()
* Streamlit model deploy: [Deploy](https://share.streamlit.io/camilamaestrelli/wage-prediction-a-regression-competition/deploy_streamlit_wage_prediction.py)

Note: Despite the fact that the EDA found some duplicated data, the deploy did not take this into account.
